# Prodict
Prodict = Dictionary with IDE friendly(auto code completion), dot-accessible attributes

# Motivation
Ever wanted to use a `dict` like a class and access keys as attributes? Prodict does exactly this. 

Although there are number of modules doing this, Prodict does a little bit more.

You can provide type hints and get auto-complete!

# Examples

![auto code complete](/auto-complete1.png?raw=true "Auto complete in action!")

# Limitations
You cannot use names of dict methods as attribute names.
